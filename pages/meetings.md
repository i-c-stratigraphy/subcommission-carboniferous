### Carboniferous Congresses

In total 20 Carboniferous Congresses have been taken place over the last hundred years. Over the decades the names have been changed with the widening scope of the congresses, but the stratigraphic subdivision of the Carboniferous remains a core topic of the meetings.

### Other meetings: 

SCCS or his working groups have organized countless meetings in the field in various countries around the globe. For several of them, reports have been included into the SCCS newsletters, but this was far from systematically done. The annual reports of SCCS are another source. Scientific symposia related to SCCS and the Commission international de microflore du Paléozoïque have also been organized over the decades, especially in the high days of the exploration the European Carboniferous coal basins. Nowadays, those activities are at least partly found in the organization of scientific session at various national and international congresses.
