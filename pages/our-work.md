# Our Work

## Purposes and ambitions

The SCCS is responsible for:

* Defining, refining, and maintaining the global stratigraphic framework for the Carboniferous Period (358.9–298.9 Ma).
* Establishing Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) — also known as “golden spikes” — which formally mark the boundaries between stages and series of the Carboniferous.
* Coordinating international research on Carboniferous stratigraphy, paleontology, sedimentology, and related topics.
* Publishing and standardizing chronostratigraphic charts and nomenclature for global consistency.

## Structure

The SCCS includes:

* A Chair, Vice-Chair(s), and Secretary (elected positions).
* 18 voting members and ca. 140 corresponding members from around the world.
* Several task groups, each focusing on specific time intervals or boundaries

## Challenges, ongoing tasks and outlook

Although the SCCS has achieved many of its primary goals, there remain ongoing tasks:

* Four stage boundaries still require GSSPs. 
* Integration of non-marine and marine successions remains a challenge, but this is the base for any successful application of Carboniferous stratigraphy in various facies realms of the different palaeocontinents
* Maintenance of an up-to-date digital presence and documentation (website, newsletters, annual reports) 
* Ensuring global geographic coverage in membership, and ensuring that stratigraphic standards apply equally across different continents and palaeogeographic domains.
* Facilitating communication on the Carboniferous including organization of conference sessions, workshops and the international congress on the Carboniferous and Permian that is held every 4 years - see [Meetings](/meetings)
* Providing an inclusive and diverse community that facilitates research aspirations at all career stages.
