# About the SCS

The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that extends from the end of the Devonian Period, about 358.9 Ma, to the beginning of the Permian Period, about 298.9 Ma. The Carboniferous System has been subdivided into two subsystems, the Mississippian and the Pennsylvanian, and contains seven stages. 

The Carboniferous world has seen important changes in the geosphere, biosphere and climate evolution. To name just a few of those events:  

* formation of the Variscan or Hercynian orogenic system,
* formation of the supercontinent Pangea, 
* waxing and waning of ice sheets on Gondwana, 
* fluctuations of glacio-eustatic sea-level, 
* appearance of wingless insects and reptiles 
* widespread forests and subsequent massive coal formation 

The Subcomission on Carboniferous Stratigraphy is responsible for:
* Defining, refining, and maintaining the global stratigraphic framework for the Carboniferous Period (358.9–298.9 Ma).
* Establishing Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) — also known as “golden spikes” — which formally mark the bases of the stages and series of the Carboniferous System.

## Why It’s Important

* The SCCS ensures that scientists worldwide are “speaking the same language” and “on the same page” when referring to Carboniferous rocks, fossils, and time intervals. It offers opportunities to the community of specialists to discuss and share ideas.
